In the process of building this todo application, I used two tools, which I was entirely new to, which are #Redux toolkit anf #tailwind css. I got to learn more about the two libraries, I never knew how handy tailwind css could be, not until I built this project. I didn,t have any cause whatsoever, to leave my html pages. It was just so smooth, and interesting to use. I also used some other libraries like framer motion, to improve the functionalities.
I really learnt alot with this project.
